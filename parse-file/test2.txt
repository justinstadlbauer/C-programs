A virtual appliance is an image containing an OS and preconfigured software that can
be run on a hypervisor. It’s the hypervisor’s job to run one or more virtual appliances.
Because a virtual appliance contains a fixed state, every time you start the virtual ap-
pliance, you’ll get exactly the same result. You can reproduce virtual appliances as
often as needed, so you can use them to eliminate the cost of installing and config-
uring complex stacks of software. Virtual appliances are used by virtualization tools
from VMware, Microsoft, and Oracle and for infrastructure as a service offerings in
the cloud.
The AMI is the virtual appliance image in AWS. It’s a special virtual appliance for use
with the EC2 service for virtual servers. An AMI technically consists of a read-only file-
system including the OS, additional software, and configuration; it doesn’t include
the kernel of the OS. The kernel is loaded from an Amazon Kernel Image (AKI). You
can also use AMIs for deploying software on AWS.
AWS uses Xen, an open source hypervisor, as the underlying technology for the EC2
service. The current generations of virtual servers on AWS use hardware-assisted vir-
tualization. The technology is called Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) and uses the
Intel VT-x platform. A virtual server run by an AMI based on HVM uses a fully virtual-
ized set of hardware and can take advantage of hardware extensions that provide fast
access to the underlying hardware.
Using a 3.8+ kernel for your virtual Linux servers will provide the best performance.
To do so, you should use at least Amazon Linux 13.09, Ubuntu 14.04, or RHEL7. If
you’re starting new virtual servers, make sure you’re using HVM images.
